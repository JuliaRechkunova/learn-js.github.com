    <h2>Buy the book early and guide its direction.</h2>
    <p>This book is highly inspired by the <a href="https://leanpub.com/manifesto" target="_blank">lean publishing model</a>. I'm releasing the book early to get feedback from you, dear readers, so that together we can make the best book about javascript tools and libraries possible.</p>

    <p>I'll be releasing updates weekly up until the book is feature complete at v1.0.0. Help me determine what it will mean for the book to be feature complete by filling out a survey asking what development tools, libraries, and programming patterns you'd be most interested in seeing covered. Email me at hi@learnjs.io or visit the book's <a href="https://github.com/learn-js/learnjs/issues" target="_blank">issues queue on GitHub</a></p>

  <h2 class="tutoring">About javascript tutoring:</h2>
  <p>Leading up to the v1.0.0 release, I'm offering one-on-one javascript tutoring as a bonus for purchasing the book early. This will help you get questions answered about any javascript/html/css project you're working on.</p>
  <p>It will also help me get a sense of what content should be added and revised in the book. I'll craft the remaining chapters based on the conversations in these tutoring sessions.</p>
  <p>The tutoring sessions will be most helpful for folks getting started with javascript. If you're already a javascript developer you might want to get the book on its own via leanpub or gumroad.</p>
