Over the past few months I've been experimenting with teaching javascript via private tutoring, workshops, books, and blog posts.

I've found that the best learning experiences combine these different methods. I'll often refer to the books during tutoring sessions and point out sections a student will find most useful, or use part of a book chapter as content for a workshop, leaving the remainder of the chapter as a take-home activity.

Additionally, I've realized that tutoring others helps improve the content I produce for books and blog posts. I get a better idea of what people struggle with and what scope of content is most helpful for people at various learning stages.

With those things in mind I'm doing a limited release of the 4-book Learn.js series bundled with 2 hours of Javascript tutoring. 

You'll likely find this bundle of books + tutoring most useful if you're just getting started with Javascript, or you've had some experience and are beginning to learn libraries like Backbone.js or Leaflet.js, or you want to start learning Node.js.

## An overview of what you'll get:

### The books:
- Ruby, Javascript, & Python: Development Environments for Beginners
- Introduction to Javascript
- Making 2d Games with Node.js & Browserify
- Making Maps with Leaflet.js

These books are currently works in progress (some more than others) totalling over 220 pages of content. You'll get all updates to the books for free.

### The tutoring:
You'll also get 2 hours of tutoring. I recommend breaking the 2 hours up into one-hour chunks. In the first hour we'll go over basics and set some learning goals along with a project that you'd like to work on. The second hour we'll schedule for one or two weeks later, giving you plenty of time to read the books and work on your project. Then in that second hour we'll go over what you've been working on, and work through any parts of the project that you've struggled with.

### The community:
There will also be a forum available to you that you can use to discuss your project and what you are learning with others who are at a similar experience level. We'll be able to work as a group in the forum to solve problems, evaluate approaches and libraries, and provide feedback on your work.

I'm limiting sales of this bundle to 35 people, and it will be available for purchase for the remainder of December. The tutoring sessions will be completed throughout January and February.

### Get the bundle:
The bundle is available for purchase at $125 through Gumroad:
